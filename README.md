# Simple Smash Stats (SSS)

Simple Smash Stats, or SSS, is a digested open-source data visualizer tool for your Smash results. 

The platform makes use of the [StartGG API](https://developer.smash.gg/docs/intro/) and, through separated online and offline sections, shows you:
- how well you usually perform (i.e., overperform, perform, or underperform).
- total # of wins,
- total # of losses,
- total # of wins by DQs,
- total # of losses by DQs,
- winrate,
- placements, and
- what competitor type you are (e.g., 0-2er, 1-2er, 2-2er, etc.).

Aside from player stats, SSS also allows you to see the hidden seeding for an event.

In the future, I hope to make it possible for you to claim your profile (i.e., via matching Twitch, Discord, or Twitter credentials from your StartGG account) to allow you to customize your profile and make it truly your own.
